<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of the project is to create a library implementing __message-based system__ integration patterns in TypeScript, enabling the deferral of decisions regarding the infrastructure layer as far into the future as possible. This includes seamless switching between __synchronous__ and __asynchronous communication__, various message transport options such as __in-memory__ and __message brokers__, as well as patterns like __inbox/outbox__, __routing__, and __message transformations__. All of this is intended to be achieved independently of the JavaScript runtime environment (edge too).


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Doesn't have something to show yet. Project is in planning, but on the days will be more, and more ðŸŽ‰ Planning stuff also. ðŸ˜Ž


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

This is a list of features that I would like to implement in the future. The list is not exhaustive and may change over time. I want to build a library that is easy to use, but also powerful and flexible.

- [ ] Message construction (Envelope Pattern) and serialization (JSON, Protobuf, Avro, etc.)
  - [ ] Object or Class based (no abstraction)
  - [ ] Commands, Events, Queries
  - [ ] Envelope (Routing)
  - [ ] Return Address
- [ ] Composable construction (Builder Pattern?)
- [ ] Message bus abstraction for synchronous and asynchronous communication
  - [ ] Point-to-Point
  - [ ] Publish/Subscribe
  - [ ] Request/Response
- [ ] Transports
  - [ ] In-memory (with Cluster support)
  - [ ] Message brokers/Streaming platforms
    - [ ] Redis Streams
    - [ ] Iggy.rs
    - [ ] Cloudflare Queues
    - [ ] RabbitMQ
    - [ ] Kafka
  - [ ] HTTP
  - [ ] WebSockets
- [ ] Pluginable/Extensible (?)
- [ ] Message patterns
  - [ ] Inbox/Outbox
  - [ ] Routing
  - [ ] Message transformation (middlewares?)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry
  - [ ] Logging
  - [ ] Metrics (Prometheus)
  - [ ] Tracing
- [ ] Patterns
  - [ ] Saga/Process Manager/Workflow
  - [ ] CQRS (Read Models, Projections, etc.)
  - [ ] Event Sourcing
  - [ ] Event Store (?)
- [ ] Migrations tools (via message transformation and message routing)
  - [ ] From one transport to another
  - [ ] From one serialization to another
  - [ ] From one message version to another
