<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The main goal of the project is to create a library implementing __message-based system__ integration patterns in TypeScript, enabling the deferral of decisions regarding the infrastructure layer as far into the future as possible. This includes seamless switching between __synchronous__ and __asynchronous communication__, various message transport options such as __in-memory__ and __message brokers__, as well as patterns like __inbox/outbox__, __routing__, and __message transformations__. All of this is intended to be achieved independently of the JavaScript runtime environment (edge too ðŸ˜Ž).


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Doesn't have something to show yet. Project is in planning, but on the days will be more, and more ðŸŽ‰ Planning stuff also. ðŸ˜Ž

<!-- CONCEPTS -->
## Concepts

The library is based on the following concepts (abstraction view):
<img src="images/core-concept.png" />

Using multiple transports and channels to communicate between different parts of the system. All based on routing via message headers and static routing configuration.

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

This is a list of features that I would like to implement in the future. The list is not exhaustive and may change over time. I want to build a library that is easy to use, but also powerful and flexible.
